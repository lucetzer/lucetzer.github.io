            <p>First day at Makers. It's finally here. I arrived at Makers early, full of excitement, curiosity and not knowing what the day will bring. Meeting my fellow cohort buddies was just awesome. EVERYONE is so lovely and excited to learn. We were all wondering what first day will bring? After all the introduction, are we going to pair-program today? What will be the challenge? What other surprises are there?</p>

<p>But first day was not what I expected. There was no coding! It was just a day dedicated to getting to know each other, meeting our coaches and understanding how the course will run for the next 12 weeks. There are around 34 people in the cohort, the biggest ever at Makers and we all played this name game where that allowed us all to remember EVERYONE'S name. It was brilliant and I won't spoil it for anyone who is thinking about joining Makers (just do it! :D). </p>

<p>Makers also offers meditation everyday at 2pm (with Chief Joy Officer) and yoga on Mondays and Thursdays. Doctor Joy (aka Dana) is responsible for our happiness (and probably sanity!) and is literally a walking sunshine. She literally beams and oozes joy. Yep, I certainly want to get some of that joyfulness to keep me going. </p>

<p>We finished early and ended up at the local pub. I have a feeling this is going to be a regular pitstop! It was a great day and I know the hard work starts tomorrow. Bring it on. </p>
