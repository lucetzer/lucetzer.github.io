            <p>TDD, also known as Test Driven Development is an important part of agile development. In a nutshell, it is about writing tests before any code, making that it sure it fails, then the writing the minimal and simplest code to make it pass, and refactoring the code at the very end. This process can be explained using a cycle called Red Green Refactor, see diagram below.  </p>

<p><left><img src="http://www.ruby-software.com/ruby-software/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/bdd-cycle3.png"></left></p>

<p>There are two key tests involved - Feature Tests and Unit Tests.</p>

<p><strong>Feature Tests</strong> tests one specific functionality e.g. such as a behaviour of a program.</p>

<p><strong>Unit Tests</strong> tests the capability of the individual objects in a program isolated from all other objects. </p>

<p>A Feature Test is conducted prior to the Unit test.</p>

<h5 id="whatisred">What is red?</h5>

<p>Red means watching a test (either feature or unit test) fail. We want the test to first fail because it confirms the validity of the test itself. </p>

<p>The first thing we do is perform a feature test and this involves writing a test for the code we wish we had. This will of course fail as we haven't written any code but this is good news! It means we can write the unit test for the components that make up this feature. Sounds weird, but we also want this to fail too! And this is for the same reasons as failing the feature test because it ensures the validity of the unit test. There may be multiple unit tests for each feature test. </p>

<p>Once both tests have failed in the expected way (the right errors), we can begin writing code that will pass both these tests. </p>

<h5 id="whatisgreen">What is green?</h5>

<p>Green means watching your test PASS!! Awesome. The first thing we do is writing the minimal amount of code to pass our unit test. This ensures our code stays clean and concise. Once we've passed the unit test, we refactor the code relating to our unit. We run the test again to double check our refactored code passes. </p>

<p>The next step is to then write code to pass the feature test, adopting the same approach as the unit test above. Once again, we refactor and test at the end.</p>

<h5 id="finalthoughts">Final thoughts...</h5>

<p>Once we've completed these steps, we have completed our program in a test-driven way. If we have done this correctly, we should have 100% coverage for our program and also the minimal amount of code possible. </p>
