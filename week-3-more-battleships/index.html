            <p>It's been a crazy couple of weeks and I've been bit behind on posting as updating to the latest Node version on Yosemite has caused a couple of issues with installing npm (package manager for JavaScript). Npm has a dependency module called sqlite3 which only works with Node.js v0.10.x or v0.12.x and Node 4.1.1. This meant I needed to download a node version manager (<a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">nvm</a>) so I can choose which node version to use before I can install npm. Thanks very much to coaches Roi and Ptolemy for helping me out!</p>

<p>The last couple of weeks have been BUSY. Back in week 2, we focused on building the Battleships game in Ruby. Week 3 was bring it alive in web. While many of us had about just enough with the game, it was still quite exciting to see how we can translate our ruby code into something that people can see and interact with. </p>

<p>There were so many new things including the client-server model, Sinatra framework and writing Capybara tests to check how your user interacts with your application. I found a lot of these concepts quite hard to grasp in the first few days and struggled to put them into practice. There were days where I went home just totally confused and feeling quite worried about the weekend challenge. I spoke to a few of my course mates and found out that I wasn't alone and it was comforting to know that we are all in the same boat. The coaches as always were really encouraging, finding different ways to explain these to us and telling us it will eventually click. It's important to not let your emotions get in the way of learning. You just have to keep moving forwards. I'm learning day by day to get to used feeling uncomfortable and not feel like I have to get everything right then and there. By Thursday afternoon, things started to become much clearer and I was feeling a lot more comfortable. By the end of the week, I managed to get a one-player game working on my local server. The web interface is still quite simple since we haven't done much html or css but hopefully we will pick this up in the weeks to come. The weekend challenge was rock, paper, scissors and completing this was a lot more management than Battleships. By Sunday, I had a one player and computer game set up!</p>

<p>Last week, we were introduced to databases, essentially a place to store information. We created a bookmark manager web app that allowed users to sign up, sign in/out, add and view web links. We used PostgreSQL to create a relational database and DataMapper to help manage database associations. We also continued to use Sinatra and Capybara to create the web interface in a test-driven way. Throughout the challenge, we picked up many gems such as bcrypt to helps to secure our passwords and factory girl which helps us refactor our capybara tests. And over the weekend, we created a simple Twitter clone that allowed users sign up, sign in and post their messages, and view all messages if sign in or out. </p>

<p>This week....JavaScript!! More on this to come...</p>
