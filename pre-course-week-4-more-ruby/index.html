<p>I've been doing Codewars and reading the <strong>The Well-Grounded Rubyist</strong> by David A. Black. So far, it's been a good resource to help you to understand the fundamentals of the Ruby language and has plenty of examples with line-by-line explanations. There are still a few elements in there that I scratch my head at particularly the last couple of chapters! Maybe in time with more practice, I will understand it more?! I hope!</p>

<p>In between reading and doing Codewars, I've been practicing Ruby Zen by doing <a href="http://rubykoans.com/">Ruby Koans</a>. At first, I was like huh? what is this path to enlightenment that I've embarked on? The format was very different and it's essentially a a list of exercises that walks you through the Ruby language, its syntax and common function BUT it asks you fix code (filling in the missing elements) in order for it to work. It's good to switch different modes of thinking to test your understanding. </p>

<p>We were also asked to look at TDD (Test Driven Development aka Behaviour Driven Development) using a tool called rspec. From what I understand so far, it's an important part of the agile development process and involves coding, testing and refactoring your code. The process of TDD is to write the test (before you write any code), watch it fail and then write the simplest amount of code in order for the program to work. I can't wait to get to know TDD better when the course starts. The last month has absolutely gone by in a blink and no more late mornings!</p>

<p>It's time to go back to school. I hope I survive the next 12 weeks!</p>
