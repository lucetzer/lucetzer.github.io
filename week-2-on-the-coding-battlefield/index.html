            <p>I survived week 2!! It's been a tough week as we've been given the challenge to build the battleships game from scratch. Before last week, I've never even played battleships despite having heard of the game many times! I downloaded the game on my phone to find out what this battle is all about. </p>

<p>The real battle of course of was actually building it! The course material was designed to make us think, research and decide how we want to build the most basic game first e.g. with one ship and one player and then slowly scale from there. This is part of the process of designing the minimum viable product however while that was useful, we did have to think about how our program can be extended to allow for multiple ships and two players. It may be a simple game but building something like this requires you to think logically about the various scenarios of the game. </p>

<p>One week later, I'm just really grateful that those ships are static! Throughout building this game, we are starting to get to know, understand and apply the SOLID principles of Object Oriented Design, all in a test-driven way of course. We've had plenty of research projects on various SOLID topics. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)">SOLID</a> (stands for Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation and Dependency inversion) sets out the five principles of object oriented programming and design and is what we follow at Makers to ensure our code easy to maintain and extend. This week we've really focused on Single responsibility (one class should have only one job) and <a href="http://lucetzer.github.io/solid-dependency-inversion/">Dependency inversion</a>. </p>

<p>We've continued to pair-program everyday and it's been very helpful. As we switch partners everyday, we are working with another set of code that may have been modelled differently. We always have to work with the code that's less developed so we can build this code back up, which helps to consolidate our learning and ensure we can explain our code to one another. </p>

<p>I've also had plenty of fun doing yoga, playing badminton and partying with fellow makers on Friday. See, life as a coder isn't all about being desk bound.</p>
