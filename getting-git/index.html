            <p>Week two of the Makers Pre-course was all about learning Git and Github. I remember just a few weeks ago, I was looking at Github and thinking I don't get what this is about and how to use it!</p>

<p>After going through Maker's online learning and git immersion exercises, I am now adding, committing, pushing, pulling, cloning, and forking like never before. I can now see why keeping a local repository and a remote repository is so important when you are working and collaborating with others on projects. No doubt when the course starts, I'm sure we will be using both of these every day to track our work. </p>

<p>It's important not to get confused between <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. They are different. Git is an open source version control system that allows you manage projects and keep track of it's changes on your computer. Github is a Git repository hosting service that allows you keep a copy of your code online so you can work and collaborate with others. Github isn't the only Git repo service available (e.g. Bitbucket) but it's a pretty damn good one from what I've seen and used so far.</p>

<p>Asides from Git and Github, I've been doing Josh Cheek's Ruby Kickstart and Chris Pine's Learn to Program. I find Chris Pine harder to understand  but it's a good workout on my brain. There's so much to cover so I better get back to it!</p>
