            <p>This week is all about practicing Ruby and finishing up our Chris Pine and Ruby Kickstart exercises. I switched up between the two just because I struggle with Mr. Pine especially when you've been hit with a cold...I mean why am I sick in summer??? But cold or not, I've soldiered on! </p>

<p>I've been addicted to doing <strong><a href="http://www.codewars.com">Codewars</a></strong> which provides code challenges in a variety of different program languages to help improve your skill and technique. The more problems you solve, the more "honors" you earn and higher you rank up in the ladder of many codewar competitors. It's great fun and the problems get really tough. There are also some extremely creative and smart solutions. When you spent hours coming up with your code to a codewar problem (aka "kata") and only realise there were others that wrote them in one line, you get stumped and amazed! But while I think code needs to be clear and concise, it's also important to write code that's can be easily read and understood. I think this makes it easier for others to work with your code and build upon it or change it if needed. I try to break the problems down into chucks first and then refactor afterwards. That's another new word for me- refactoring. This is the process of when improving the code without changing what it's intended to do. So many new things to learn and I think I'm only scratching the surface at the moment.  </p>

<p>Some of us in the September class also met up at Makers Academy to do some <strong>pair-programming</strong>. It was a great afternoon as I got the feel of what it's like to code and solve problems together as well as getting to know the Makers Academy space. We'll be doing a lot more of pair-programming so I'm looking forward to learning from others and sharing my knowledge. I also met up with my mentor who gave some tips about the course and we also worked on a Codewar problem together. While in the middle of this, a loud "GONG" sound went off and everyone on the floor cheered. I seriously thought it was beer time but it actually meant someone has landed a job! I like how Makers is so focused on preparing us to be job-ready and it is possible to get work if you do the work! </p>
