<p>In Week 5, we focused on learning javascript - a completely new language! I feel a little nervous at first considering I've still got so much to learn on Ruby but I've found that knowing one language has helped greatly with picking up another. From what I have learnt so far, there are some similarities. In Ruby, we have been writing an object as a class and methods of the object in a class. When we need to create an object, we instantiate that class. In Javascript, we write functions and like Ruby, Javascript can also be object-oriented with functions pertaining to that object and being able to create new prototypes that uses those functions. </p>

<p>Our task for the week was to rebuild our airport challenge in javascript and then build a simple digital thermostat. We test-drove the thermostat web app with Jasmine and used jQuery, HTML and CSS to build an interactive front-end that allows users to increase, decrease and reset the temperature. It also has a power-saving mode! Throughout the week, I worked with others to work out how we can use a weather API to help tell the temperature of a city that has been entered by the user. It was quite a struggle in the beginning to work out the syntax but we finally got it work! I also included HTML Geolocations to help determine the user's location and get their local temperature. I've still yet to work out how to get this up and running on Heroku and basically my life at the moment is about debugging! You can an image of it above.</p>

<p>Week 6 is lab week at Makers so this is a week where we get to review the work from the last few weeks, work on something on your own or with a group. We were also given a challenge to build a bowling game scorecard. Yes, Makers makes sure you always have work to do! ;) </p>

<p>There was so much to do this week and I was really burnt out. I worked with a few others on building a battleships game, went home to review more code, spend time with my partner, get up and do it all over again. The mental exhaustion really caught up with me and by Wednesday afternoon, I was exhausted, head-hurting, sore throat... you know how it works. I went home and woke up early Thursday morning with a temperature before going back to bed. I slept for a total of 13 hours and it really helped. </p>

<p>I took it easy the next few days and made sure I came first in the equation before doing any coding! Looking after yourself is really important and this was good reminder of that. I will certainly be reviewing my routines to ensure that I get enough me time and am in optimal shape to continue learning! After all, there's another six weeks in the course and not to mention a lifetime of learning after Makers! </p>

<p>In other non-coding related news, I walked passed Sam Smith today and ended up humming "I'm not the only one" home. He looks exactly like he does in the news. Funny that.</p>
